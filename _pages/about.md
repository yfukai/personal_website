I am Yohsuke T. Fukai, a postdoctoral researcher in the non-equilibrium physics of living matter research group of Riken Hakubi (Kobe, Japan).
I have studied universal fluctuation in non-equilibrium systems, in particular interfacial fluctuation and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, as well as pattern formation in liquid crystal electroconvection.

I am now focusing on biological questions related to cell differentiation and chromatin structure. I perform biophysical experiments in the non-equilibrium physics of living matter Riken Hakubi research team, RIKEN, BDR. I also have a passion for software development and am a keen contributor to open source projects.
